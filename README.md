# Introducing Myself 

## Background 
I am a second year MSPH student in GDEC. My background is mostly in laboratory sciences as I have an undergraduate degree in Biomedical Laboratory Diagnostics. I also have worked for several years in translational research. As such most of my coding experience is limited to Prism/Graphpad and very basic functions in R which I've used to make figures in the past. 

*Fun facts about me!*

1. I was raised in Los Angeles and grew up backpacking in the Sierra Nevadas

2. I am currently living in Peru while working on my practicum 

3. I have two black belts in Tae Kwon Do and Hap Ki Do

4. The most books I've read in a year is 73

5. I baked bread before the pandemic made it trendy 

## Research Interests
I am interested in infectious disease, particularly neglected tropical diseases. I have become very keen on monitoring and evaluation of health intervention programs related to these diseases. These are often conditions which have fairly straightforward preventative or treatment interventions, however are not ideally implemented. This is a gap which I hope to help address throughout my career.

Below is a website for World Chaga's Day. 
Which is a campaign to raise awareness of one such disease

## Learning Goals 
In this class I hope to become more proficient at using statistical programs to generate useful and visually appealing reports.
